# LoveNote

####Commands
- ng serve -o (This will run the front end server on localhost:4200)
  - This will update as you make changes in Angular in real time
- git push heroku master (This will deploy to heroku) 
- npm run dev (this will start the backend server)
  - This will also serve up the Angular front end on static files if you run 'ng build' first.
  - To access the angular static files, use localhost:4000, same as backend

####Dependencies
- I used jsonwebtoken v8.5.1 instead of v8.1.0
- I used passport-jwt v4.0.0 instead of v3.0.1
